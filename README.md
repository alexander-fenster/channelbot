# Telegram channel bot

The idea of the bot is to allow using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
channel with comments as a discussion group. By sending a message to the bot,
the participant is able to post to a channel, and other participants could
comment on their post in the attached comment thread.

## Configuration

Please edit the corresponding values in `config-sample.yml` and save it as `config.yml`.
Follow Telegram [instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots) on creating a bot.
Then invite your bot to your channel (making it an admin).

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
